Dynamic pharmacophore modeling of molecular interactions.

Dynophores are an intuitive tool to explore the dynamics of molecular interactions between 
a macromolecule and a ligand throughout an MD simulation: 

A __dynophore__ is a collection of so-called __superfeatures__. 
A superfeature is defined as a pharmacophore feature on ligand site 
(defined by a feature type, e.g. HBA, and one or more ligand atom numbers/serials) that occurs 
at least once during an MD simulation. A superfeature can have one or more interaction partner(s) 
on macromolecule-side. 
These interaction partners are called __environmental partners__. 
Superfeatures and their environmental partners are monitored throughout an MD simulation.

#### Documentation

The documentation will be available soon.

#### Overview

This Python library offers visualization schemes for dynophore data generated with the `DynophoreApp` (TODO: add link to software): 

- Plot statistics on superfeatures and interactions (TODO: link to tutorial)
- Show superfeature clouds in 3D using the NGLviewer (TODO: link to tutorial)
- Show superfeatures mapped onto the ligand in 2D (TODO: link to tutorial)
